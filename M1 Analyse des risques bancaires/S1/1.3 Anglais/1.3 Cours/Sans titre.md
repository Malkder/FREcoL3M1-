	Collateral framework has key objectives :
- Support the central reaching its objectives of price and financial stability
- to mitigate risk in its operation
- minimize price distortions across assets classes
	CB collateralize all lending operations to reduce risk (collateralised risk)
	Collateral is intended to protect CB from potential financial loss in the case banks are not able to meet their laon obligations
	CB do not accept any type of asset as collateral. Collateral framework is supposed to define a list of low risk assets based on specific eligibility criteria

	Monetary policy may be able to support a greener economy by lending facilities, to conduct OMO (**Operation on open market**)
	Using those facilities, CB supply loans to financial institution
	However existing collateral framework are at odds with the Paris Agreement, they create disproportionately better financing conditions for carbon-intensive activities. They are also reinforcing various financial market failures

##### Greening collateral framework
- Collateral framework should be aligned with climate targets / Paris Agreement targets
- Green bonds / Sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) can be incorporated into collateral framework
	In June 2018, PBC decided to include green bond into the pools of their assets eligible as collateral for its medium term lending facility
- CB can decide to exclude carbon-intensive assets from collateral assets / to incentivise banks to shift away from these assets (assign a haircut to these assets)

##### Conclusion`
Climate change is a devilishly complex challenge that affects all aspects of our life. It affects weather, biodiversity, access to sustainability of water and land ressources, air pollution inequality, employment...
